Hi I am Pawan Yadav. The green fox jumps over the lazy dog, that thing is too useless for me. Lofy is that you? I really don't care what they say, this weather is just weird. Did you see that guy with the red hat? He looked like he was from another planet. Oh wait, maybe he was! Sometimes I wonder why people even bother. The sky is blue, the grass is green, and I'm still confused. Tell me, do you believe in aliens or is that just nonsense? My phone keeps buzzing, but no one ever calls. It’s like the universe is playing tricks on me. I had a dream about flying last night, but then I fell off a cliff. Not cool. Anyway, back to reality. There once was a cat who wore a hat, but he got stuck in a vat. Now everyone says, “Where’s the cat?” and no one answers back. That’s life, I guess. If I had a dollar for every time I thought about this, I’d be rich by now. Why does everything smell like pizza today? Is someone baking it in the next room? Or is my brain just hungry again? I swear, sometimes my thoughts are louder than traffic. But hey, at least I’m not alone in this mess. Right?
